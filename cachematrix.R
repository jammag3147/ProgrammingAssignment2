##Functions that cache the inverse of a matrix

##Create matrix, which is a list containing functions

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


##Calculate inverse of the matrix created with above function, reusing cached result if available

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ##Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
